# METAR-and-TAF
Program uses https://aviationweather.gov/ API to get METAR AND TAF data from ICAO stations.

Users can input ICAO station IDs in a text file named "ids.txt" in same folder as program to get output of METARs and TAFs from the stations from the past 24 hours.

Output given in two text files "metars.txt" and "tafs.txt"
NOTE: It must be noted that all the METARS of all stations are put in one text file only, same is for TAFs
